# Diagnose contamination from negative controls

[![lifecycle-experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange)](https://adrientaudiere.github.io/MiscMetabar/articles/Rules.html#lifecycle)

Build a four-panel patchwork figure to inspect potential contamination
from negative-control samples (extraction blanks, PCR blanks, etc.).

Panels:

- **A** boxplots of total reads and taxa richness per sample, split by
  negative-control status.

- **B** dumbbell of the top contaminant taxa (mean relative abundance in
  NC vs real samples), with mean read counts annotated above each point.

- **C** heatmap of the taxa detected in any negative control across all
  samples; absences are drawn in white, columns are faceted by NC
  status.

- **D** PCoA ordination (Bray-Curtis by default) with samples coloured
  by NC status.

The patchwork subtitle reports the number of real and negative-control
samples.

## Usage

``` r
neg_control_diag_pq(
  physeq,
  neg_control,
  top_n_heatmap = 30,
  top_n_contaminant = 20,
  log10_transform = TRUE,
  ordination_method = "PCoA",
  ordination_dist = "bray",
  palette = c(`FALSE` = "#4C72B0", `TRUE` = "#D55E00"),
  title = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- physeq:

  (phyloseq, required) A phyloseq object.

- neg_control:

  An expression evaluated on sample_data that returns TRUE for
  negative-control samples (e.g., `is_control == TRUE`,
  `sample_type == "blank"`). Use `.` to refer to the phyloseq object.

- top_n_heatmap:

  (integer, default: 30) Maximum number of taxa shown in the heatmap
  (panel C). Taxa are ranked by total reads in negative controls.

- top_n_contaminant:

  (integer, default: 20) Maximum number of taxa shown in the contaminant
  ranking (panel B).

- log10_transform:

  (logical, default: TRUE) If TRUE, apply `log10(x + 1)` to the heatmap
  fill (panel C), the y-axis of panel A, and the ordination input (panel
  D). If FALSE, raw counts are used.

- ordination_method:

  (character, default: "PCoA") Method passed to
  [`phyloseq::ordinate()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/phyloseq/man/ordinate.html).

- ordination_dist:

  (character, default: "bray") Distance metric for the ordination.

- palette:

  (character) Length-2 named vector with entries `` `FALSE` `` (real
  samples) and `` `TRUE` `` (negative controls). Defaults to a
  blue/orange contrast.

- title:

  (character, default: NULL) Optional title placed above the figure. The
  subtitle (real / NC sample counts) is added automatically.

## Value

A
[patchwork::patchwork](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/patchwork-package.html)
object with the four diagnostic panels.

## Examples

``` r
library(MiscMetabar)
data(data_fungi)
# Mark the three lowest-depth samples as mock controls for demo
pq <- mutate_samdata_pq(
  data_fungi,
  is_control = sample_sums(.) < sort(sample_sums(.))[4]
)
neg_control_diag_pq(pq, is_control)
